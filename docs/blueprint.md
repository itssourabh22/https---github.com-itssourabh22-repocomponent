# **App Name**: RepoSight

## Core Features:

- Automated Component Analysis: Analyze code repositories and automatically identify, categorize, and catalog components. The analysis tool uses file structure patterns, import/export statements, class definitions, configuration files, documentation patterns and naming conventions as input to the analysis tool.
- Component Catalog View: Presents identified components in a visual structure, enabling users to filter by type, owner, technology, and tags.
- System Map View: Displays a dependency graph to visualize relationships between components. Provides a map view showing component relationships and data flow.
- Individual Component Pages: Presents links to source code, dependency relationships, and extracted documentation for each component. Enables users to review component details, dependencies, and documentation in a single interface.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) - A vibrant blue (#3399FF) to convey trustworthiness and intelligence, reminiscent of tech interfaces. This choice is based on the application's core function of code analysis.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - A light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) that provides a clean and neutral backdrop, ensuring readability and focus on the code components.  The subdued saturation keeps the interface calm and professional.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) - A contrasting teal (#33A699) for interactive elements, buttons, and highlights, providing a visual distinction from the primary color and guiding user actions. This provides balance against the vibrancy of the primary blue, in a natural-feeling analogous hue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, neutral aesthetic that supports readability and aligns with contemporary UI design.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent component types and functionalities. Consistent visual style enhances usability.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the Component Catalog and System Map views to provide a structured and organized presentation.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as expanding component details or highlighting dependencies.
